Installing bundled ruby + fastlane:

Download the .zip file, and double click on the install executable (or run it from a terminal) and follow the on screen instructions.

This will move the ruby + fastlane bundle into `~/.fastlane` in addition to adding that directory to your `$PATH` variable.

To get started using fastlane, either open a new shell, or `source` your configuration file (e.g. `~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, etc.).

Before using _fastlane_ the first time, run `which fastlane` to ensure the path looks something like `/Users/[user]/.fastlane/bin`. If it doesn't, make sure to add the above mentioned directory to your `PATH` environment variable.
