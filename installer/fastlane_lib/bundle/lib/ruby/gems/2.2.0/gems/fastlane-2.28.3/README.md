#### ✨ Check out [docs.fastlane.tools](https://docs.fastlane.tools) on how to get started with fastlane ✨

`fastlane` is a tool for iOS, Mac, and Android developers to automate tedious tasks like generating screenshots, dealing with provisioning profiles, and releasing your application.

Use a lane to define your process:

```ruby
lane :beta do
  increment_build_number
  cocoapods
  match
  testflight
  sh "./customScript.sh"
  slack
end
```

Then to deploy a new 'beta' version of your app just run
`fastlane beta` :rocket:
